# Sooty

Sooty is a tool developed with the task of aiding SOC analysts with automating part of their workflow. One of the goals of Sooty is to perform as much of the routines checks as possible, allowing the analyst more time to spend on deeper analysis within the same time-frame. 

Sooty is now proudly supported by [Tines.io](https://tines.io?utm_source=github&utm_medium=sponsorship&utm_campaign=sooty)! The SOAR Platform for Enterprise Security Teams.

## Requirements and Installation
 - [Python 3.x](https://www.python.org/)
 - Install all dependencies from the requirements.txt file. `pip install -r requirements.txt`
 - Launch the tool by navigating to the main directory, and executing with `python3 Sooty.py`, or simply `Sooty.py` 
 - Several API Keys are required to have full functionality with Sooty, however it will still function without these keys, just without the added functionality they provide, links are found below:
   - [VirusTotal API Key](https://developers.virustotal.com/reference)
   - [URLScan.io API Key](https://urlscan.io/about-api/)
   - [AbuseIPDB API Key](https://www.abuseipdb.com/api)
   - [HaveIBeenPwned API Key](https://haveibeenpwned.com/API/Key)
   - [PhishTank API Key](https://www.phishtank.com/api_info.php)
 - Replace the corresponding key in the `example_config.yaml` file, and rename the file to `config.yaml`, example layout below:
 - For PhishTank support, an unique app name is also required as an additional field. Simply update the `config.yaml` file with your unique name.

 <!-- - To use the Hash comparison with VirusTotal requires an [API key](https://developers.virustotal.com/reference), replace the key `VT_API_KEY` in the code with your own key. The tool will still function without this key, however this feature will not work.
 - To use the Reputation Checker with AbuseIPDB requires an [API Key](https://www.abuseipdb.com/api), replace the key `AB_API_KEY` in the code with your own key. The tool will still function without this key, however this feature will not work.
 - To use the URLScan.io checker function with URLScan requires an [API Key](https://urlscan.io/about-api/), replace the key `URLSCAN_IO_KEY` in the code with your own key. The tool will still function without this key, however this feature will not work. 
 - Use of the HaveIBeenPwned functionality requires an [API Key](https://haveibeenpwned.com/API/Key), replace the key `HIBP_API_KEY` in the code with your own key. The tool will still function without this key, however this feature will not work. -->
